Let's look an example.

If you have a bag with 5 marbles, 3 yellow and 2 blue and you want to know the probability of picking 2 yellow marbles in a row, that would be

𝑝(𝑌1,𝑌2)=𝑝(𝑌1)𝑝(𝑌2|𝑌1).

𝑝(𝑌1)=35

since you have an equally likely chance of drawing any of the 5 marbles.

If you did not put the first marble back in the back after drawing it (sampling without "replacement"), then the probability

𝑝(𝑌2|𝑌1)=24

, so that

𝑝(𝑌1,𝑌2)=3524=310.

But if you put the first marble back, then

𝑝(𝑌2|𝑌1)=35=𝑝(𝑌2)

, so that

𝑝(𝑌1,𝑌2)=3535=925.

In the first case 𝐴
and 𝐵 (or rather 𝑌1 and 𝑌2

) are not independent, whereas in the second case they are.

What will be the probability of both balls being blue? Compute this in both cases (i) when you put back the first blue ball and (ii) when you did not put back the first blue ball.

Answer: 
i.) When the ball is put back, the probability of pulling two blues is p(B1,B2) = (2/5)(2/5) = 4/25 or 0.16
ii.) When the ball is ~not~ put back, the probability of pulling two blues is p(B1,B2) = (2/5)(1/4) = 2/20 or .10

We say that two random variables, 𝐴
and 𝐵

are independent if

𝑝(𝐴,𝐵)=𝑝(𝐴)𝑝(𝐵)
(knowing 𝐵 does not give any information about 𝐴 and vice versa).
