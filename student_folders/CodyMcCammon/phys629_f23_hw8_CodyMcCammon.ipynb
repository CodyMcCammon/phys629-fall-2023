    "This week's problem is worth 40 points. This problem uses a dataset in `/coursework/homeworks/hw_data/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Read in `hw8_data.npy`, which is a (3 x 20) numpy array. Set `x, y, sigma_y = data`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to do some polynomial fits to this data just like in the lecture. However, in all cases you should **keep the $y$-intercept fixed at $-0.23$**. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use the following code to compute the un-normalized posterior pdf (i.e., just the likelihood x prior) on a grid of the linear coefficient (i.e., the slope) of a linear model, with a uniform prior between 0.5 and 1.5. Plot this posterior pdf. Remember this is just a one-dimensional model because the $y$-intercept is fixed. I advise a grid size of 100."
